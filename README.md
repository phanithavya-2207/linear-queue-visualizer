# linear-queue-visualizer

A simple and interactive **Linear Queue Visualizer** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project demonstrates how a linear queue works with operations like:
- Enqueue (insert)
- Dequeue (remove)
- IsEmpty (check if the queue is empty)
- Clear Queue (reset the queue)

It includes a **visual animation** of the queue using colored blocks for front, rear, and queue elements.
